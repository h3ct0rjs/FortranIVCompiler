# Lexical Analyzer 

This is the Lexical Analyzer for our *mini**Fortran***,we base all our research in the 1330/1800 Ibm Manual, 
we try to keep this code as simple as possible and used the minimun python tricks, 
we just use the small trick for unpacking sets. 

We use the Sly tutorial in order to implement this code. 

## Running Code

You will need to have **python3.6** and sly library, we've created a bash script to automate this:

```sh
user@host:~$ git clone  https://github.com/h3ct0rjs/FortranIVCompiler
user@host:~$ cd FortranIVCompiler/Lexer/
user@host:~$ ./**run.sh**
```
